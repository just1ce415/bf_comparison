"'VOLUME THE THIRD': notebook containing two early novels, 'Evelyn' and 'Catharine, or the Bower', by Jane Austen; 6 May 1792-19 Aug. 1809, n.d. Mostly autograph. This is the third of the surviving three volumes of Jane Austen's juvenilia; 'Volume the First' is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS Don.e.7) and 'Volume the Second' is in the British Library (Add. 59874). All contain copies, with some later additions and revisions, of original manuscripts which do not survive. On the inner front cover (f. ii), Jane Austen's father, the Rev. George Austen, has noted in pencil: 'Effusions of Fancy by a very Young Lady consisting of Tales in a Style entirely new'. The contents page (f. 1) is signed 'Jane Austen May 6th 1792'; the dedication of 'Catharine' (originally entitled 'Kitty') to Cassandra Austen (f. 16v) is dated 'Steventon August 1792'; and at the end of 'Evelyn', the last few pages of which (ff. 12-15) are in an unidentified hand, is the date 'August 19th 1809'. This hand appears again towards the end of 'Catharine' (ff. 63v-64); the last two pages of the story, which is unfinished, are in the hand of Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen Leigh (ff. 64v-65). Four pages loosely inserted at the end of the volume (ff. 66-69), containing a contribution to 'Evelyn', are in the hand of Jane Austen's eldest niece, Jane Anna Elizabeth Lefroy, and are signed with her initials. See R. W. Chapman, Volume the Third by Jane Austen (Oxford, 1951); notes by him, dated 28 and 30 July 1950, are inserted at the end of the volume (ff. iii, iv). See also B. C. Southam, 'Interpolations to Jane Austen's Volume the Third', in Notes and Queries, vol. 207 (May 1962), pp. 185-187. Dedication to James Edward Austen Leigh, in the hand of Cassandra Austen, at f. 1. Purchased, with the aid of a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, at Sotheby's, 27 Sept. 1988, lot 108. Paper; ff. v+69. Old pagination 1-127. 202 x 163mm. Binding of vellum with 'Volume the Third' on the front cover and 'aft. 18' (perhaps referring to the writer's age) at the top of the spine, both in Jane Austen's hand","","032-001990460","Fonds.

"THE TWO final chapters, numbered 10 and 11, of Persuasion by Jane Austen, as originally composed. Holograph. The novel, as published posthumously (2 vols, 1818), retains the final chapter, renumbered 12 but discards the other in favour of a new chapter 10 and a partly new chapter 11, the latter incorporating with slight alterations the section of the old chapter 10 from 'that as to character' to 'motive for remaining here' (ff. 6 b-8 b, 15-16, corresponding to vol. 2, pp. 283-292, of the first edition). The present MS. was edited anonymously in 1926 as Two Chapters of Pesuasion, where a full account is given; the cancelled chapter had already been printed by J. E. Austen-Leigh, A Memoir of Jane Austen, 2nd ed, 1871, pp. 167-180. See also British Museum Quarterly, i, pp. 15-17 and plate V. Paper; ff. 16. 6 in. x 3.5/8 in. Dat. 8-18 July, 1816. After that date a passage (ff. 15-16 b) for insertion at f. 8 b in ch. 10 was added. A slip pasted on f. 16 b runs: 'The contents of this Drawer for Anna' i.e. Anna Lefroy, niece of Jane Austen","","032-001985160","Fonds.
